WRF Ensemble Management can help you create WRF ensembles from GEFS reanalysis
data via submodule **lazyWRF**. It can also post-process the data (such as 
computing ensemble means, creating postage-stamp plots of all members, etc)
via submodule **postWRF**.

Where do I start?
=================

Documentation is here (incomplete): http://johnrobertlawson.github.io/WEM/

```./lazyWRF/``` contains scripts that form the basis of automating your WRF 
ensemble runs. ```./postWRF/bin/``` contains examples of post-processing that
you may like to perform with the module. The other essential file you will need 
to personalise for post-processing is /bin/settings.py. The class therein contains
all the settings for loading data, saving output, etc. Almost all settings can be
left as default (by not specifying a setting), other than essentials like 
the path to your WRF data, the path to output figures, etc.

To run ```lazyWRF```, the top-level script must be in your WPS folder to allow WPS
executables to see the namelist.wps. So you might need to soft-link from your WPS
directory to where you keep your top-level lazyWRF/WEM controlling scripts (e.g.,
```ln -sf /path/to/WEM/scripts/``` in your WPS folder). At least,
I can't find a way around this.
